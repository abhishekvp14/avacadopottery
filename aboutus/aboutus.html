            <br><p>Aruvacode potters are originally from Andhra Pradesh brought to Kerala by the Kovilakam people in order to make pot for their temple related activities. But later on they stayed back and were provided land by the Kovilakam owners. It would have been over 100 years since they moved into Kerala. The demand for clay pots reduced as plastic and aluminium replaced them at cheaper rates. They still remain as the authentic potter’s family staying true to the traditional way of pottery. They use only natural sustainable colours and materials for the process.</p><br>

            <p>Years ago, Aruvacode was infamous for the kind of work the people did. The depressing condition in their family made them so and so as it was the only way they could live a life. The appreciation goes to Mr. KB Jinan and a police officer Mr. Radhakrishnan for turning the village of sex workers to the potter’s village by reviving their culture and showing a pathway to these lost souls through the art of pottery.</p><br>

            <p>From 153 families the number has come down to 7 families who are involved in this art. They have arranged a small space outside their home for the process. The art of pottery is very divine to them and the whole family indulged in the process of making aesthetic pots, vases, cups and plates. Women were not supposed to work during their monthly cycles. Initially women didn’t work on the wheels but now with the invention of machine wheels, Aruvacode stand as the sole place with women wheelers. Footwear isn’t worn to their workplace. They never sell a damaged product though it isn’t visible to a normal person as it is against their work ethics.</p>
